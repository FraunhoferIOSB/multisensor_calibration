In this, the functionalities provided by OpenCV are utilized to detect markers and compute the pose of the calibration target with respect to the camera. To deduce the pose of the target from the marker detection, the algorithm requires the intrinsic parameters of the camera, which is why a good intrinsic calibration is vital. The image points of the detected markers are stored to be later used as 2D correspondences as part of the PnP algorithm. Furthermore, with the image positions of the detected markers and the a priori knowledge about the calibration board geometry, a 3D point cloud of the calibration target is also created. The detections, as well as the 6-DOF Pose of the target and the reconstructed 3D point cloud are published after the detection was successful. In this, the marker ID to which the detected corner belongs is stored in the intensity value of the point. Calibration Target Detection in the LiDAR Data \u00b6 The detection and pose estimation of the calibration target within the LiDAR cloud data is realized in a number of consecutive steps. In this numerous algorithms from the Point Cloud Library (PCL) are used. First, the input point cloud is segmented into planer regions using a region growing algorithm. This algorithm requires the point cloud to have normal vectors which are computed prior to the region growing. After that each segmented cluster whether its size and aspect ratio fits to the geometry of the calibration target. If so, the cluster is considered as region of interest (which are also published as preview) in which a detailed detection and pose estimation of the target is performed. In this, the algorithm fits a rotating bounding box to the cluster and checks its dimension. When the actual target detection and pose estimation is to be performed, the orientation of the bounding box is first aligned to the actual orientation of the calibration target using the arrangement of the cutouts. In this, all possible orientations are tested by counting the points in the point cloud at the assumed location of the cutouts. The orientation for which the smallest number of points have been accumulated is taken as the orientation of the target. This pose is used as an initialization to a RANSAC algorithm which tries to fit a custom sample consensus (SAC) model of the calibration target to the segmented region of interest. In this it computes the normal vector of the board based on a random set of points from the cluster and varies position and rotation of the target pose with each RANSAC iteration. Finally the pose with the most inliers is chosen as the winner-takes-it-all solution. As inliers all point that lie on the calibration target are chosen. With each point that falls into the circular cutout, the current estimation is penalized by reducing the number of inliers by a certain factor. When RANSAC has found a pose, the coefficients are optimized by fitting a CAD model into the point cloud using GICP. In this only the points forming the convex hull of the cloud segmented from the input cloud are used. Finally, the 3D coordinates of the marker corners are deduced based on the estimated board pose and stored as 3D correspondences. The detections, as well as the 6-DOF Pose of the target and the segmented 3D point cloud are published after the detection was successful. In this, the marker ID to which the detected corner belongs is stored in the intensity value of the point. The parameters for the algorithm outlined above are exposed as dynamic parameters and can be adjusted by calling rqt_reconfigure or opening the preferences from the UI ( Edit->Preferences ).

If the deviation between points normals is less than the smoothness threshold then they are suggested to be in the same cluster. region_growing_curvature_thresh : Second criteria for the region growing.

An overview of these parameters is given blow: limit_single_board_rpj_error : Use max maximum reprojection error to accept during calibration of a single target pose. If false, 'board_max_rpj_error' is ignored. single_board_max_rpj_error : Limit for maximum reprojection error to accept during calibration of a single target pose.

Error Computation and Estimation of Calibration Certainty \u00b6 In the calibration using the PnP algorithm to align two sensors by means of 2D-3D correspondences, the quality of the calibration is measured by the mean reprojection error .html). For a good calibration a typical reprojection error lies between 2-4 Pixels. In the calibration of two 3D sensors in which the sensor data gets aligned by means of GIPC, the quality of the calibration is measured using the root mean squared error (RMSE) . For a good calibration a typical RMSE lies in the range of view centimeters. To quantify the certainty of the result, the standard deviation of the individual target poses is also calculated. In this, for a given extrinsic calibration the poses of the detected calibration target are projected from the coordinate frame of the source sensor into the coordinate frame of the reference sensor. The standard deviation in the translational and rotational difference should give us a good indication on the consistency of the calibration.","title":"Data Processing"},{"location":"data_processing/#data-processing","text":"","title":"Data Processing"},{"location":"data_processing/#calibration-target-detection-in-the-camera-data","text":"The calibration target is detected in the image data by means of the ArUco markers.

This is not relevant for this nodelet. ~/import_marker_observations : Service to import a set of marker observations. This is not relevant for this nodelet. ExtrinsicCameraLidarCalibration(Nodelet) \u00b6 Nodelet to perform extrinsic camera-LiDAR calibration without any ui or guidance. How to use as standalone: After starting up, the calibration nodelet continuously detects the ArUco marker inside the camera image and selects possible region of interests inside the LiDAR cloud. It publishes the marker detections as well as the regions of interest in the topic '~/<camera_sensor_name>/annotated_image' and '~/<lidar_sensor_name>/regions_of_interest', respectively. Visualize the data published in the previous step for example in rviz and make sure that the calibration target is seen both in the camera image as well as the LiDAR scan. To trigger the detection of the calibration target and to capture its pose, call the provided service of the calibration nodelet: '~/capture_target'. Depending on the data, the detection of the target can take up to a couple of seconds. When the target has successfully been detected in both the camera image as well as the LiDAR data, an instant calibration is performed with just this target pose. A corresponding message is printed in the command line with the mean reprojection error of this calibration. If not successful a corresponding message is also printed. Typical reasons for a detection not being successful is either that the target is not detected in the LiDAR scan or that the reprojection error exceeds a certain threshold (Default: 2px). If latter is the case the threshold can be increased by calling 'rqt_dynamic_reconfigure'. Since the detection of the calibration target from the camera image is very reliable, only the detection inside the LiDAR cloud is published for visual inspection, i.e. inside the topics '~/<lidar_sensor_name>/target_pattern' and '~/<lidar_sensor_name>/marker_corners'. If the detected pose is not satisfactory one can remove the last detection by calling the appropriate service: '~/remove_last_observation'. For a good calibration 5 to 7 different poses of the calibration target should be used, ideally moving it around the three coordinate axes. For each pose, repeat steps 2-7. When enough different calibration poses are collected, the calibration can be finalized by calling the service: '~/finalize_calibration'. This will do a final calibration, print out the resulting extrinsic parameters as well as the overall mean reprojection error and the confidence of the calibration. The calibration results and a urdf snippet, together with the observations (if requested) are written into the calibration workspace. NOTE: For a good final calibration a typical mean reprojection error is between 2-4 pixels. Launch-Parameters: robot_ws_path : Path to the folder holding the robot workspace.

It publishes the marker detections as well as the regions of interest in the topics '~/<[src|ref]_lidar_sensor_name>/regions_of_interest'. Visualize the data published in the previous step for example in rviz and make sure that the calibration target is seen both in the camera image as well as the LiDAR scan.

A corresponding message is printed in the command line with the mean reprojection error of this calibration. If not successful a corresponding message is also printed. Typical reasons for a detection not being successful is that the target is not detected in the LiDAR scan. The detection inside the LiDAR cloud is published for visual inspection, i.e. inside the topics '~/<[src|ref]_lidar_sensor_name>/target_pattern' and '~/<[src|ref]_lidar_sensor_name>/marker_corners'.

The idea in this calibration is that for which have LiDAR sensors that also \"see\" part of the robots body, on can estimate the position of the LiDAR sensor by aligning the LiDAR scans to a model of the robots body. This is done by manually selecting corresponding regions in both sensor cloud and model. To do so, use the point picking tool of rviz to pick a point in the corresponding clouds round which a planar region is to be estimated. The selected regions are then aligned using a GICP. For region selection a plane is fitted into the cloud at a selected marker point using RANSAC. Prior to GICP the clouds are filtered using Statistical Outlier Removal. The transformation guess for the GICP is computed by using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to estimate a rigid transformation from the seed points around the selected region markers.

This can then be used to colorize the distance in a point cloud viewer, such as rviz. To calculate the distance between the point clouds, this nodelet uses two distance measures, which can be selected by the appropriate launch parameter: point_2_point : This calculates the euclidean distance between each point in the source point cloud and the nearest neighbor in the target point cloud (transformed into the frame of the source point cloud). In this, it finds the n nearest neighbors (ordered by their distance) and takes the distance to the first one in the list. point_2_surface : In order to calculate the distance of a point to a surface, information on the surface normal needs be available. Thus, in this case, the nodelet first computes the normal vectors for the transformed target point cloud. It then, again, finds the n nearest neighbors in the target point cloud to each point in the source cloud. The distance is then calculated by first computing the plane parameterization for each neighbor and its corresponding normal vector. This followed by calculating the orthogonal distances of the source point w.r.t. each parameterized surface. The smallest of these orthogonal distances is then selected as the point-2-surface distance. Prior to calculating the distance between two point clouds, the target point cloud is transformed into the coordinate system of the source point cloud. In this way, since the source cloud is to be enhanced with distance information, the source cloud does not need to be transformed back prior to publishing. The transformation is found, by first extracting the frame IDs from header of each point cloud, which can then be used to look it up in the TF tree. Launch-Parameters: number_of_clouds : Number of clouds to process. The input topics are appended with a index as suffix: cloud_0 , cloud_1 , ..., cloud_N-1 .

Especially when using point clouds from a rotating LiDAR, as a parameterization of a small number of neighbors might lead to a selection of all neighbors on one ring, making the surface estimation less accurate. num_nearest_neighbors : Number of nearest neighbors to consider in the target cloud for each point in the source cloud.

For each point cloud in the list, the smallest distance with respect to all other point clouds is found. The calculated distance is normalized with respect to a given maximum distance and stored in the intensity field of the source point cloud. This can then be used to colorize the distance in a point cloud viewer, such as rviz. To calculate the distance between the point clouds, this nodelet uses two distance measures, which can be selected by the appropriate launch parameter: point_2_point : This calculates the euclidean distance between each point in the source point cloud and the nearest neighbor in the target point cloud (transformed into the frame of the source point cloud). In this, it finds the n nearest neighbors (ordered by their distance) and takes the distance to the first one in the list. point_2_surface : In order to calculate the distance of a point to a surface, information on the surface normal needs be available. Thus, in this case, the nodelet first computes the normal vectors for the transformed target point cloud. It then, again, finds the n nearest neighbors in the target point cloud to each point in the source cloud. The distance is then calculated by first computing the plane parameterization for each neighbor and its corresponding normal vector. This followed by calculating the orthogonal distances of the source point w.r.t. each parameterized surface. The smallest of these orthogonal distances is then selected as the point-2-surface distance. Prior to calculating the distance between two point clouds, the target point cloud is transformed into the coordinate system of the source point cloud. In this way, since the source cloud is to be enhanced with distance information, the source cloud does not need to be transformed back prior to publishing.

Extrinsic Camera-LiDAR Calibration \u00b6 The camera-LiDAR calibration is comprised of estimating a relative transformation of a given camera sensor with respect to a given LiDAR sensor. The calibration is performed by solving the Perspective-n-Point (P-n-P) problem with the help of a series of 2D-3D-point-correspondences. Figure 1: Graphical user interface of the extrinsic camera-LiDAR calibration after the calibration target has been detected in the camera image and the LiDAR point cloud. In this, the camera image is annotated with the corners of the ArUco markers and the detected target structure is highlighted with yellow in the LiDAR point cloud. After starting up, the GUI, as depicted in Figure 1 , will appear. It is made up of, - a 'Control Window' (A), - a view on the target detections in the camera images (B), - a view of the target detections in the LiDAR cloud (C), as well as - a view on a dialog that is supposed to guide the user in the placement of the calibration target (D) (currently in development) . The calibration node continuously detects and tracks the ArUco marker inside the camera image and selects potential candidates of the calibration target inside the LiDAR cloud. In this, the markers are framed and for the points of the target candidates in the point cloud are displayed with the corresponding intensity value. To perform an extrinsic calibration, follow the steps below: Start off by placing the calibration target in the center of the camera image and parallel to the image plane. Place the target at such a distance to the camera, that its width will fill out approximately half of the image width. Make sure that the markers are detected in the camera image and the target structure is highlighted in the LiDAR cloud. If at least 3 markers are detected and the target structure is highlighted, click on Button 1 'Capture Target Observation' to trigger full detection and precise estimation of the calibration target in the sensor data and to add the detection to the observation list. When finished the corresponding sensor data will be annotated with the detections as seen in Figure 1 . In this, the camera image will be annotated with the corners of the detected ArUco markers (color coded with rainbow color map according to the ID of the marker). the points of the LiDAR cloud that correspond to the detected calibration target are highlighted in yellow. In addition, from the estimated pose of the target, the corners of the ArUco markers are also drawn in the same color scheme as in the camera image. Perform a visual inspection on whether the orientation of the calibration target in the LiDAR cloud was estimated correctly. This is important , since accurate 2D-3D correspondences between the marker corners in the camera image and the LiDAR cloud are needed for the P-n-P algorithm to estimate the extrinsic sensor pose. If the orientation was not correctly estimated, or if a wrong structure in the LiDAR cloud was supposedly marked as the calibration target, or any other fault, you can remove the last observation from the stack by clicking on Button 2 'Remove Last Observation' . This can be repeated multiple times as it will always remove the top-most observation on the stack until no observation is left. Continue to add (6-7) different poses of the calibration target by placing it at the top and/or bottom edge of the image, at the left and/or right edge of the image, and further away. At each position, slightly rotate the target inwards. Ideally place the target in a '+' shape in the image space with 5 positions. If not possible, try to place the target at least at 3 positions in a 'L' shape so that the positions are not collinear. For each position repeat steps 2-5 . When enough different observations of the calibration target are collected, the calibration can be finalized by clicking on Button 4 'Calibrate' . This will do a final calibration, print out the resulting extrinsic parameters, overall mean reprojection error, as well as a standard deviation in the target poses when transforming it from the source sensor to the reference sensor. For a good final calibration a typical mean reprojection error is between 2-4 pixels, a translational (XYZ) standard deviation of 1-3 cm, and a rotational (RPY) standard deviation of 0.1-1.5 degrees. After finalization, the calibration can be visualized by clicking the Button 3 'Visualize Current Calibration' . This will open a new dialog with the projection of the LiDAR cloud into the camera image and colorized according to their distance from the camera. Thus, if the calibration is good, then the structure in the LiDAR scan (which can be derived from the depth coloring) should align with the object in the image. the calibration results, as well as a snippet for the URDF file is written into calibration workspace . The workspace folder containing the result files can directly be opened by navigating through the program menu 'File' -> 'Open' -> 'Calibration Workspace' . To adjust runtime parameters, e.g. parameters of the algorithm to detect the calibration target or to do the actual calibration algorithm, you can open 'rqt_reconfigure' via 'Edit' -> 'Preferences'. Extrinsic LiDAR-LiDAR Calibration \u00b6 The LiDAR-LiDAR calibration is comprised of estimating a relative transformation of a given source LiDAR sensor with respect to a given reference LiDAR sensor. The calibration is performed by aligning a cloud of the source sensor, holding detections of a calibration target, with the cloud of the reference sensor, holding the same observations, by means of GICP. Figure 2: Graphical user interface of the extrinsic LiDAR-LiDAR calibration after the calibration target has been detected in the data of the LiDAR scanners. In this, the detected target structure is highlighted with yellow in the LiDAR point cloud. After starting up, the GUI, as depicted in Figure 2 , will appear. It is made up of, - a 'Control Window' (A), - a view on the target detections in the source LiDAR cloud (B), - a view of the target detections in the reference LiDAR cloud (C), as well as - a view on a dialog that is supposed to guide the user in the placement of the calibration target (D) (currently in development) . The calibration node continuously selects potential candidates of the calibration target inside the LiDAR clouds. In this, the points of the target candidates in the point cloud are displayed with the corresponding intensity value. To perform an extrinsic calibration, follow the steps below: Start off by placing the calibration target in front of the sensor for which the extrinsic pose is to be calibrated (i.e the source sensor), while at the same time making sure it can also bee seen from the reference sensor. The target should be placed at such a distance, that the circular cutouts on the calibration target can be well identified. In this, a rule of thumb would be that if possible 2-3 scan lines should pass through or touch a cutout Make sure that the structure of the calibration target is highlighted in the data of both sensors, i.e. in window B and C. If the target structure is highlighted in the data of both LiDAR scanners, click on Button 1 'Capture Target Observation' to trigger full detection and precise estimation of the calibration target in the sensor data and to add the detection to the observation list. When finished the corresponding sensor data will be annotated with the detections as seen in Figure 2 . In this, the points of the LiDAR cloud that correspond to the detected calibration target are highlighted in yellow. In addition, from the estimated pose of the target, the corners of the ArUco markers are also drawn in the same color scheme as in the camera image. Perform a visual inspection on whether the orientation of the calibration target in the LiDAR clouds was estimated correctly. If the orientation was not correctly estimated, or if a wrong structure in the LiDAR cloud was supposedly marked as the calibration target, or any other fault, you can remove the last observation from the stack by clicking on Button 2 'Remove Last Observation' . This can be repeated multiple times as it will always remove the top-most observation on the stack until no observation is left. Continue to add (3-5) different poses of the calibration target by placing it at a higher or lower position in front of the source sensor. in front of the reference censor, and further away. In this the positions should make up an 'L' shape, so that a vertical, as well as a horizontal variance is established. Make sure that the positions are not collinear. At each position, slightly rotate the target inwards. For each position repeat steps 2-5 . When enough different observations of the calibration target are collected, the calibration can be finalized by clicking on Button 4 'Calibrate' . This will do a final calibration, print out the resulting extrinsic parameters, the overall root mean squared error of the GICP, as well as a standard deviation in the target poses when transforming it from the source sensor to the reference sensor. For a good final calibration a typical root mean squared error is between 3-8 cm, a translational (XYZ) standard deviation of 0.5-5 cm, and a rotational (RPY) standard deviation of 0.3-2 degrees. After finalization, the calibration can be visualized by clicking the Button 3 'Visualize Calibration' . This will open a new dialog visualizing the point-wise distance between the two point clouds. In this, the point-wise distance visualized with a rainbow colormap (red -> yellow -> green -> blue -> violet). This means, that if the calibration is good, the point-wise distance in overlapping regions should be small and, in turn, the corresponding points should ideally be highlighted in red. the calibration results, as well as a snippet for the URDF file is written into calibration workspace . The workspace folder containing the result files can directly be opened by navigating through the program menu 'File' -> 'Open' -> 'Calibration Workspace' . To adjust runtime parameters, e.g. parameters of the algorithm to detect the calibration target or to do the actual calibration algorithm, you can open 'rqt_reconfigure' via 'Edit' -> 'Preferences'. Extrinsic Camera-Reference Calibration \u00b6 The camera-reference calibration is comprised of estimating a relative transformation of a given camera sensor with respect to a reference. Similar to the camera-LiDAR calibration, the transformation is calculated by solving the Perspective-n-Point (P-n-P) problem with the help of a series of 2D-3D-point-correspondences. However, instead of finding the 3D correspondences by detecting the calibration target in LiDAR data, they can be entered manually by providing the 3D coordinates of the top-left corners of the ArUco markers with respect to a given reference frame ID. Figure 3: Graphical user interface of the extrinsic camera-reference calibration after the calibration target has been detected in the data of the camera. In this, the camera image is annotated with the corners of the ArUco markers. After starting up, the GUI, as depicted in Figure 3 , will appear. It is made up of, - a 'Control Window' (A), - a view on the target detections in the camera images (B), - a table view (C) which allows to enter the XYZ coordinated of the top-left marker corners, as well as - a view on a dialog that is supposed to guide the user in the placement of the calibration target (D) (currently in development) . The calibration node continuously detects and tracks the ArUco marker inside the camera image, framing the ArUco markers.

In this, the camera image will be annotated with the corners of the detected ArUco markers (color coded with rainbow color map according to the ID of the marker). If the detection was faulty, you can remove the last observation from the stack by clicking on Button 2 'Remove Last Observation' . This can be repeated multiple times as it will always remove the top-most observation on the stack until no observation is left. Continue to add (6-7) different poses of the calibration target by placing it at the top and/or bottom edge of the image, at the left and/or right edge of the image, and further away. At each position, slightly rotate the target inwards. Ideally place the target in a '+' shape in the image space with 5 positions. If not possible, try to place the target at least at 3 positions in a 'L' shape so that the positions are not collinear. For each position repeat steps 2-4 . After all target poses were captured in the camera image, fill in reference coordinates of the top-left marker corners in the appropriate table, together with the corresponding ID of the target pose and the corresponding marker ID. To this end, it is assumed that the observed target poses are entered in a contiguous order, starting off with the ID 1. Meaning, that the first position of the target gets the ID 1, the second the ID 2, and so on. Furthermore, for each target pose there are to be 4 markers given. You can also enter the reference coordinated successively while you move the target around, however, it is important that the observations are only 'applied' once at the end , when all coordinates have been entered. When enough different observations of the calibration target are collected and the reference coordinates of the top-left marker corners have been entered and 'applied', the calibration can be finalized by clicking on Button 4 'Calibrate' . This will do a final calibration, print out the resulting extrinsic parameters, overall mean reprojection error, as well as a standard deviation in the target poses when transforming it from the source sensor to the reference sensor.

The calibration is performed by solving the Perspective-n-Point (P-n-P) problem with the help of a series of 2D-3D-point-correspondences. Figure 1: Graphical user interface of the extrinsic camera-LiDAR calibration after the calibration target has been detected in the camera image and the LiDAR point cloud. In this, the camera image is annotated with the corners of the ArUco markers and the detected target structure is highlighted with yellow in the LiDAR point cloud. After starting up, the GUI, as depicted in Figure 1 , will appear. It is made up of, - a 'Control Window' (A), - a view on the target detections in the camera images (B), - a view of the target detections in the LiDAR cloud (C), as well as - a view on a dialog that is supposed to guide the user in the placement of the calibration target (D) (currently in development) . The calibration node continuously detects and tracks the ArUco marker inside the camera image and selects potential candidates of the calibration target inside the LiDAR cloud. In this, the markers are framed and for the points of the target candidates in the point cloud are displayed with the corresponding intensity value. To perform an extrinsic calibration, follow the steps below: Start off by placing the calibration target in the center of the camera image and parallel to the image plane. Place the target at such a distance to the camera, that its width will fill out approximately half of the image width. Make sure that the markers are detected in the camera image and the target structure is highlighted in the LiDAR cloud. If at least 3 markers are detected and the target structure is highlighted, click on Button 1 'Capture Target Observation' to trigger full detection and precise estimation of the calibration target in the sensor data and to add the detection to the observation list. When finished the corresponding sensor data will be annotated with the detections as seen in Figure 1 . In this, the camera image will be annotated with the corners of the detected ArUco markers (color coded with rainbow color map according to the ID of the marker). the points of the LiDAR cloud that correspond to the detected calibration target are highlighted in yellow. In addition, from the estimated pose of the target, the corners of the ArUco markers are also drawn in the same color scheme as in the camera image. Perform a visual inspection on whether the orientation of the calibration target in the LiDAR cloud was estimated correctly. This is important , since accurate 2D-3D correspondences between the marker corners in the camera image and the LiDAR cloud are needed for the P-n-P algorithm to estimate the extrinsic sensor pose. If the orientation was not correctly estimated, or if a wrong structure in the LiDAR cloud was supposedly marked as the calibration target, or any other fault, you can remove the last observation from the stack by clicking on Button 2 'Remove Last Observation' . This can be repeated multiple times as it will always remove the top-most observation on the stack until no observation is left. Continue to add (6-7) different poses of the calibration target by placing it at the top and/or bottom edge of the image, at the left and/or right edge of the image, and further away. At each position, slightly rotate the target inwards. Ideally place the target in a '+' shape in the image space with 5 positions. If not possible, try to place the target at least at 3 positions in a 'L' shape so that the positions are not collinear. For each position repeat steps 2-5 . When enough different observations of the calibration target are collected, the calibration can be finalized by clicking on Button 4 'Calibrate' .
